# PSTAT-231-Final-Project

The primary aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting housing prices based on a comprehensive set of features, including location, property characteristics, and economic indicators. By leveraging regression algorithms, the project seeks to determine the relationship between various housing attributes and their effects to housing price.

The research question we aim to address is: Can we predict housing prices based on the chosen variables using machine learning algorithms? To answer this, we will use regression models, such as KNN, and random forests, which are suitable for capturing relationships between multiple input features and a continuous target variable, the housing pr
